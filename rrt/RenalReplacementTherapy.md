### Indications for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)
Primary goal of RRT is to compensate for loss of renal function & correct it’s associated sequelae, including:
- Accumulation of nitrogenous waste products
- Electrolyte disturbances
- Metabolic acidosis
- Volume overload

Indications for commencing RRT:
- Development of uraemic signs or symptoms
- Management of ﬂuid overload
- Electrolyte disturbance:
  - Hyperkalaemia >6.5 refractory to medical therapy
  - Less common: Na, Ca, phosphate , Mg & uric acid
- Metabolic acidosis
- Dialyzable or ﬁlterable toxins (Aspirin, Lithium, Methanol, Ethylene Glycol, Methotrexate, Theophylline, myoglobin metabolites etc.)

## Types of RRT
Intermittent vs. continuous

Continuous RRT is applied for (or aimed at being applied for) 24 hours/day
Advantages: slower ﬂuid removal therefore more haemodynamically stable, the slower control of solute concentration therefore avoiding large ﬂuctuations and ﬂuid shifts
Disadvantages: Need for immobilisation, the use of continuous anticoagulation, risk of hypothermia

Intermittent RRT is performed for less than 24 hours in a 24 hour time frame several times per week
Advantages: Fast removal of toxins and decreased treatment time
Disadvantages: Theoretically causes greater haemodynamic instability with large ﬂuid shifts (risk of cerebral oedema), technically more complex and demanding, expensive

The London Clinic ICU uses continuous RRT

### Haemodialysis
The mechanism of solute clearance is by diﬀusion. Solutes in blood pass down a concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane, which is maintained by the counter ﬂow of dialysate replacement ﬂuid.

In Figure 1 below the arrows that cross the membrane indicate the predominant direction of movement of each solute through the membrane; the relative size of the arrows indicates the net amounts of the solute transferred. Other arrows indicate the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow.

![Figure 1.](figs/figure1.jpg)

### Haemoﬁltration
The mechanism of solute clearance is by convection. Blood under pressure passes down one side of a highly permeable membrane allowing both water and substances up to molecular weights of between 30-50,000 kDa to pass across the membrane by convective ﬂow. Refer below to Figure 2.

![Figure 2.](figs/figure2.jpg)

### Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis is an alternative mechanism of renal replacement therapy. Fluid is instilled into the abdomen via a special catheter and allowed to remain there for some time (dwell time), during which ﬂuids and electrolytes diﬀuse across the peritoneal membrane.

This guideline does not consider peritoneal dialysis

## Vascular Access
Blood ﬂow through the haemoﬁlter circuit is dependent on good access to the blood stream. The better the ﬂow of blood the more efﬁcient the treatment and the longer the ﬁlter lasts. If the pressures in the circuit become too great (i.e too negative in venous arm and too positive across the membrane or in the arterial arm) then the machine will alarm, the blood pump stops and the chance of clotting the circuit increases. Micro-bubbles can also form in the circuit if the negative pressure in the venous arm is too great.

Correct type and placement of the venous dialysis catheter is essential to maintain good ﬂow.

Type of catheter:
- MAHURKAR 11.5Fr x 16 cm for internal jugular or subclavian
- ? 20 cm line equivalent for femoral

Insertion Site:
First choice: Internal jugular vein (right in preference to the left)
Exception: Femoral vein to be used ﬁrst line in the following situations:
- Emergencies
- Signiﬁcant coagulopathies
- Un-intubated patients unable to lie ﬂat
- Access problems causing ﬁlter clotting
- Deﬁnite plan for high-ﬂux haemoﬁltration

Subclavian veins are less favoured due to ﬂow problems and the increased incidence of stenosis which has implications for long term renal support or permanent pacing. Contraindicated in coagulopathic patients

**All lines must be inserted under ultrasound guidance using full aseptic technique**

Placement:
The optimal position for the tip of a dialysis catheter (when inserting via the internal jugular or subclavian vein) is in the region of the superior vena cava – right atrial junction, typically at the level of the right main bronchus (see below)

![Figure 2.](figs/figure3.jpg)

Catheter Lock – Heparin Lock

Vascular access may become compromised with clot if an anticoagulant agent is not locked within the catheter lumens.
All dialysis catheters should be heparin locked (add heparin concentrate) access if not in use for more than 4 hours (unless heparin is contraindicated e.g. patient has HIT).

Heparin-lock **MUST be ASPIRATED** prior to re-using the lines

## Approach to Anticoagulation for RRT

Systemic unfractionated heparin:
- CVVHF 1L exchange unless otherwise stated by ICU consultant
- Systemic heparin administration (given pre-ﬁlter) as per ICU guidance (link to guidance).
- Aiming for APPTR: 2 – 2.5
- All patients on systemic heparin should be monitored for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopaenia (HIT), if HIT is suspected the patient should be discussed with the haematology anticoagulation team.

Epoprostenol / Prostacyclin (PGI2):
- CVVHF 1L exchange unless otherwise stated by ITU consultant
- Prostacyclin may be used in cases of HIT or in some patients with hepatic failure where heparin has little anticoagulant effect due to low antithrombin III levels and frequent clotting is problematic
- Prostacyclin may be administered in conjunction with heparin or as a sole therapy
- Epoprostenol / Prostacyclin and Heparin can be administered together (by 3 way tap) into the predilution anticoagulation line of both the Infomed and Prismaﬂex machines
- Refer to the guidance for Epoprostenol (link)

## Thromboprophylaxis during RRT
Thromboprophylaxis should be administered according to the hospital guidelines for all patients during RRT (unless the patient is being systemically anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin for RRT or other has other contraindications to thromboprophylaxis).

Graduated compression stockings and/or intermittent pneumatic compression devices should be used unless contraindicated

## Haemodynamically unstable patients
Commencement of haemoﬁltration can cause cardiovascular instability. Consider the following:
- Prepare metaraminol (10mg in 20mL) before initiation of therapy
- Prepare a colloid infusion that can ﬂow rapidly before initiation of therapy
- Start with a blood ﬂow rate 50mL/min and titrate up as tolerated to the target blood ﬂow rate

Anticipate falls in blood pressure with small doses of metaraminol, rather than attempting to rescue severe hypotension

## Overnight
It is not always essential to replace a clotted haemoﬁlter between midnight and 08:00. Consider delaying re-initiation of therapy until the morning in patients who have been established on haemoﬁltration for over 24 hours and who also fulﬁl the following criteria:
- Serum potassium <6 mmol/L
- pH>7.30
- Projected ﬂuid balance at 08.00 not likely to compromise the patient
- No speciﬁc instructions made on the ward round to continue haemoﬁltration
- Patient is not being cooled for a neurological injury

If haemoﬁltration is delayed > 4 hours then catheters should be locked with unfractionated heparin
